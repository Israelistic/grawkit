# Grawkit - The Awksome Git Graph Generator

Grawkit is a tool that helps build SVG graphs from git command-line descriptions, and is built in Awk.

## Testing & Documentation

A `Makefile` is provided for running tests and producing documentation for Grawkit. Run `make help` in the project root for more information.

A full test-suite is provided (depending only on `make` and `awk`), which should serve as a good example of the existing feature-set.
